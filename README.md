# HAOS for Sonoff iHost

This is an unofficial port of [Home Assistant Operating System (HAOS)](https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system) to run on [Sonoff iHost (Smart Home Hub Appliance) hardware by ITead](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-ihost-smart-home-hub/).

Documentation specific to this port is in this wiki -> https://github.com/darkxst/ha-operating-system/wiki/HAOS-on-Sonoff-iHost

A reason for using this port is that this hardware represents one of the most inexpensive ways to run HAOS on a decent dedicated appliance, and another reason is repurposing the hardware Sonoff iHost if you have outgrown its own built-in features, functions and supported devices.

(FYI, compared to the official [Home Assistant Green](https://www.home-assistant.io/green/), Sonoff iHost comes with build-in Zigbee Coordinator, similar to [Home Assistant Yellow](https://www.home-assistant.io/yellow/)).

## Home Assistant Operating System

Home Assistant Operating System (a.k.a. Hass.io/Hassio formerly HassOS) is a Linux-based operating system optimized to host [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) and its [Add-ons](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/). Home Assistant OS is an all-in solution and has a management user interface that can be used from the Home Assistant's frontend.

Home Assistant OS itself is a combination of Home Assistant's [core](https://github.com/home-assistant/core), [frontend](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend), [supervisor](https://github.com/home-assistant/supervisor), [addons](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons), and tools which allows users to easily run and maintain it different computer platforms without maintaining a operating system separately. 

Home Assistant Operating System uses Docker as its container engine. By default it deploys the Home Assistant Supervisor as a container. Home Assistant Supervisor in turn uses the Docker container engine to control Home Assistant Core and Add-Ons in separate containers. Home Assistant Operating System is **not** based on a regular Linux distribution like Ubuntu. It is built using [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/) and it is optimized to run Home Assistant.

## Development

If you don't have experience with embedded systems, Buildroot or the build process for Linux distributions it is recommended to read up on these topics first (e.g. [Bootlin](https://bootlin.com/docs/) has excellent resources).

The Home Assistant Operating System documentation can be found on the [Home Assistant Developer Docs website](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/operating-system).
